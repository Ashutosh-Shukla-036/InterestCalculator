# Interest Calculators Project

This project provides web-based calculators for computing **Simple Interest** and **Compound Interest**. It features a **frontend** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and connects to a **backend** API (Node.js with Express) for performing the calculations.

## Features

- **Simple Interest Calculator**  
  Calculate simple interest based on principal, interest rate, and time.
  
- **Compound Interest Calculator**  
  Calculate compound interest based on principal, interest rate, time, and compounding frequency.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express API)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS

## How to Use

### Simple Interest Calculator
1. Enter the principal amount, rate of interest (in percentage), and time (in years).
2. Click the **Calculate** button.
3. The calculated simple interest will be displayed.

### Compound Interest Calculator
1. Enter the principal amount (P), annual interest rate (R in percentage), time period (T in years), and the number of times the interest is compounded per year (N).
2. Click the **Calculate** button.
3. The calculated compound interest will be displayed.

## Backend Endpoints

The backend API provides two POST endpoints:

- **/SimpleInterest**:  
  Accepts `p` (principal), `r` (rate), and `t` (time) as input and returns the computed simple interest.

- **/CompoundInterest**:  
  Accepts `p` (principal), `r` (rate), `t` (time), and `n` (number of times interest is compounded per year) as input and returns the computed compound interest.

## Project Structure

```bash
/index.html        # Contains the structure of the interest calculators and JavaScript to connect the backend to frontend
/styles.css        # Contains styles for the interest calculators
/index.js          # Contains Backend logic for interest calculators
```

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ashutosh-Shukla-036/Interest-Calculator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
   ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. **Install backend dependencies**:
   ```bash
    npm install
   ```

4. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
    npm start
   ```

5. **Open `index.html`** in a browser to access the calculators.
